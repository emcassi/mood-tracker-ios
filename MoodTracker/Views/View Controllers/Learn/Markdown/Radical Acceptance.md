**Accept this moment exactly as it is**

Radical acceptance is a distress tolerance strategy that involves wholeheartedly accepting reality as it is, without trying to change it. This practice stems from the understanding that resistance to reality often exacerbates suffering. By embracing life's challenges without judgment, individuals can decrease their emotional pain and find peace, even in the midst of difficult circumstances. Radical acceptance does not mean approval or resignation but acknowledges the present moment without fighting against it, paving the way for constructive action and emotional healing.

**Radical** - *All the way, complete and total*

## Remember
- Everything is caused, whether we like the cause or not
- Life can be worth living, even with these painful moments

## What do we need to accept?
- Reality as it is, not as we wish it would be
- There are limitations on the future for everyone

- Liking or accepting your current situation
- Approval, compassion, love, passivity, or against change
- Weakness
- Failure

## Why accept reality?
- Rejecting reality does not change reality
- Changing reality requires first accepting reality
- Pain cannot be avoided; it is nature's way of signaling that something is wrong
- Rejecting reality turns pain into suffering
- Refusing to accept reality can keep you stuck in unhappiness, bitterness or other painful emotions
- The path out of hell is through misery. By refusing to accept the misery that is part of climbing out of hell, you fall back into hell.

## Factors that interfere with acceptance
- You do not have the skills
- You believe accepting means you are making light of it or approving of the facts
- Emotions get in the way

Radical acceptance is a powerful tool for transforming the relationship with emotional pain, offering a path to freedom and peace in the face of life's inevitable challenges.
