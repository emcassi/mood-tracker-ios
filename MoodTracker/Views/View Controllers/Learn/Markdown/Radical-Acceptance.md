# Radical Acceptance
## ***Accept this moment exactly as it is***

## Radical acceptance is **not**:

- You giving up
- Liking or accepting our current situation
- Approval, compassion, love, passivity, or against change
- Weakness
- Failure

## Radical acceptance is when you:
- Accept reality
- Accept what you cannot change

### Some notes
- Everything is caused, whether we like the cause or not
- Life can be worth living, even with these painful moments
- It is completely okay to have sadness about your current situation

Radical - *All the way, complete and total*

## What do we need to accept?
- Reality as it is, not as we wish it would be
- There are limitations on the future for everyone
- Everything has a cause
- Life can be worth living even with painful events in it

## Why accept reality?
- Rejecting reality does not change reality
- Changing reality requires first accepting reality
- Pain cannot be avoided; it is nature's way of signaling that something is wrong
- Rejecting reality turns pain into suffering
- Refusing to accept reality can keep you stuck in unhappiness, bitterness or other painful emotions
- The path out of hell is through misery. By refusing to accept the misery that is part of climbing out of hell, you fall back into hell.

## Factors that interfere with acceptance
- You do not have the skillls
- You believe accepting means you are making light of it or approving of the facts
- Emotions get in the way
