# Be Mindful (Coping Skills)


In DBT, the **How** and **What** skills form the foundation of mindfulness training, intricately linked to guide individuals towards living more mindfully and consciously. 

The **What** skills—observe, describe, and participate—outline the core activities essential for mindfulness practice, emphasizing the importance of paying attention to the present moment, labeling experiences without judgment, and immersing oneself fully in current activities. 

Complementing these, the **How** skills—non-judgmentally, one-mindfully, and effectively—detail the manner in which these activities should be approached. These skills advocate for engaging in each moment without criticism, focusing on one thing at a time to avoid fragmentation of attention, and acting in ways that align with one's goals and values. 

Taught together, these skills empower individuals to navigate their internal and external experiences with greater awareness, balance, and effectiveness, fostering a sense of presence and engagement that enhances overall well-being and emotional resilience.

## The What Skills

### Observe
  - We can notice external events through our senses
  - And internal events via
    - Thoughts
    - Body sensations
    - Emotions
    - Urges
    
### Describe
  - Put words to your experience, without judgment
  - Describe a thought as a thought, not a fact
  - To describe a feeling, use an emotion word
    - Instead of "Math is the worst", say "I feel frustrated with math."

### Participate
  - Fully immerse yourself in the current activity with undivided attention
  - Engage in experiences without holding back
  - Allowing yourself to become wholly involved in the moment, action, or emotion at hand
  
### Note
- You can only do one **What** skill at a time.

## The How Skills

### Non-judgmentally
  - Practice observing thoughts, feelings, and sensations without labeling them as good or bad.
  - Focus on facts rather than interpretations or assumptions.
  - Recognize biases and judgments, and gently guide yourself back to a neutral standpoint.
  
### One-mindfully
  - Engage in one activity at a time to promote full concentration and presence.
  - Avoid multitasking, which can dilute attention and reduce the quality of experience.
  - Embrace the moment fully, whether you're eating, walking, talking, or listening.
  
### Effectively
  - Act in ways that are most likely to achieve your goals, without being hindered by emotions or impulses.
  - Focus on what works in a situation rather than what is "right" or "wrong" according to your personal judgments.
  - Be pragmatic and adaptable, changing strategies as needed to fit the circumstances.
