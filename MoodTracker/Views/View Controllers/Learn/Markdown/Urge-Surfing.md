# Urge Surfing

**Urge surfing** is a *technique for managing your unwanted behaviors. Rather than giving in to an urge, you will ride it out, like a surfer riding a wave. After a short time, the urge will pass on its own.*


## Why urge surf?

This technique can be used to stop or reduce

- Drug and alcohol abuse

- Emotional reactions such as "blowing up"

- Gambling

- Other unwanted behaviors


## How to Practice Urge Surfing

1. Acknowledge you are having an urge

2. Notice your thoughts and feelings without trying to change or suppress them.

	- *Note*: It is normal to feel some discomfort during an urge
	
3. Remind yourself

	1.  It is okay to have urges. They are natural reactions to habits.
    
	2.  Some discomfort is okay. I don't have to change it.
    
	3.  An urge is a feeling, not a "must". I can have this feeling and choose not to act.
    
	4.  An urge is temporary. Like any other feeling, it will pass on its own.
    
	
## Other Skills

- Managing Triggers
	- Use coping skills to reduce the power of triggers. Know your triggers ahead of time, and have a strategy or skill prepared for each one.
	
    - Examples
    
        - Deep breathing if stressed
        
        - Eating if hungry
        
        - Leaving a location if it is high risk
        
	
- Delay & Distraction

	- Do something to take your mind off the urge. Every minute you delay increases the chance of the urge weakening on its own.
	
    - Examples
    
        - Go for a walk
        
        - Listen to music
        
        - Call a friend
        
        - Use the **5 Senses** skill
