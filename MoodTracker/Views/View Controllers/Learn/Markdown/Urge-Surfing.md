# Urge Surfing

**Urge Surfing** is a mindfulness technique used in various therapies and treatments for addiction, to help individuals navigate and cope with intense urges or cravings without acting on them. This technique metaphorically compares urges to ocean waves, suggesting that like waves, urges will naturally rise, peak, and eventually fall if one does not act on them. The concept encourages individuals to observe their cravings from a distance, without judgment, allowing them to pass without engaging in the behavior they are trying to avoid or change.

## How to Urge Surf

### Observation: 
  - Pay close attention to the physical sensations and emotions associated with the urge, noticing how they change over time without trying to alter or judge them.
    - *Note*: It is normal to feel some discomfort during an urge
  
### Non-engagement
  - Resist the impulse to act on the urge, instead staying present with the sensations and thoughts, observing them as an outside witness.
  
### Mindfulness
  - Use mindfulness techniques to stay focused on the present moment, acknowledging the urge without getting wrapped up in narratives about it.
  
### Patience
  - Recognize that urges are temporary and will pass in time, much like a wave that builds, peaks, and eventually subsides.

### Acceptance
  - Accept the presence of the urge without viewing it as a directive to act, understanding that having urges is a normal part of human experience.

## Notes
###  Remind yourself
	1.  It is okay to have urges. They are natural reactions to habits.
	2.  Some discomfort is okay. I don't have to change it.
	3.  An urge is a feeling, not a "must". I can have this feeling and choose not to act.
	4.  An urge is temporary. Like any other feeling, it will pass on its own.
    
## Other Skills

### Managing Triggers
	- Use coping skills to reduce the power of triggers. Know your triggers ahead of time, and have a strategy or skill prepared for each one.
	
    - Examples
        - Deep breathing if stressed
        - Eating if hungry
        - Leaving a location if it is high risk
        
	
### Delay & Distraction
	- Do something to take your mind off the urge. Every minute you delay increases the chance of the urge weakening on its own.
    
    - Examples
        - Go for a walk
        - Listen to music
        - Call a friend
        - Use the **5 Senses** skill
