# Wise Mind

**Wise Mind** is a concept from DBT that represents a balanced state of mind where an individual can acknowledge and integrate both emotional and rational responses. It contrasts with **Emotion mind**, where decisions and reactions are dominated by feelings, possibly leading to impulsive and irrational behaviors, and **Reason Mind**, where logic and facts dictate one's actions, potentially ignoring emotional needs and values. Wise mind is about finding the middle ground, recognizing the validity of both emotional and rational inputs, and making decisions that are both thoughtful and attuned to one's feelings. This balance allows for a more holistic approach to problem-solving and decision-making, enabling individuals to act in ways that are congruent with their overall well-being.
