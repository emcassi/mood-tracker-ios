Distress tolerance focuses on developing skills to cope effectively with painful emotions and stressful situations without resorting to harmful behaviors. This key component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) encourages acceptance and endurance of negative emotions, recognizing them as part of life rather than something to avoid or suppress. By building distress tolerance, individuals learn to navigate challenging emotions and situations with resilience, reducing the impulse to act on distress-driven behaviors that may exacerbate problems.

- **Self-Soothing Techniques:** Employ self-soothing techniques that engage the senses, providing comfort and reducing immediate feelings of distress.

- **Distraction Strategies:** Utilize healthy distraction methods to temporarily divert attention from distressing emotions or situations, allowing time for emotional intensity to decrease.
